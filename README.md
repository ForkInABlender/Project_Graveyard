# Welcome to the project graveyward

Welcome to the project graveyward, where the projects might not be fully dead. They are kept hear as reference material for anyone looking to get into programming,
 software development, full stack programming, small tid-bits of what pen testing and hacking looks like, and reverse engineering. Do note I am not responsible for your
  misuse of code even from this repository.
